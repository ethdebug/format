title: ethdebug/format/materials/source-range
description: |
  A range of bytes in a particular source.

  Note that this refers to the bytes range in the original character encoding
  for the source, not the character encoding used for strings in this JSON
  format (UTF-8). For compilers that support input sources in encodings other
  than this format's transmission encoding, compilers **must** address source
  ranges in this original encoding, and debuggers **must** re-encode source
  contents obtained from this format _before_ performing any range addressing.

  (Compilers that only accept UTF-8 or ASCII are naturally exempt from this
  concern.)
