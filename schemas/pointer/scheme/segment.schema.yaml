title: ethdebug/format/pointer/scheme/segment
description: |
  An addressing scheme for pointing to a range of bytes in a data location
  arranged as individually-addressable word-sized slots.

  **Note** that this addressing scheme permits addressing byte ranges that
  extend beyond the last byte of a particular slot, or even covering the range
  of multiple slots.

  In such cases, this schema defines the range as the concatenation of bytes
  across slots such that the address of the first byte after the end of slot
  `p` (i.e., `{ "offset": "$wordsize" }`) is interpreted as the first byte of
  slot `p + 1`.

type: object

properties:
  slot:
    $ref: "schema:ethdebug/format/pointer/expression"
  offset:
    description: |
      The starting byte index within the slot.

      This field is **optional**. If unspecified, it has the default value of
      `0`, indicating that the segment begins at the start of the specified
      slot.

      This field's expression must resolve to a value _n_ such that
      0&nbsp;â‰¤&nbsp;_n_&nbsp;\<&nbsp;`$wordsize` (i.e., the offset **must**
      begin inside the slot).

    default: 0
  length:
    description: |
      The length of the bytes range this segment represents.

      This field is **optional**. If unspecified, its default value indicates
      that the segment ends at the end of the slot.

      If this field has value larger than the default value, i.e., if the
      segment extends beyond the last byte in the slot, then this segment is
      defined to be the concatenation of the sequentially-addressed slot(s)
      following following the slot specified.
