title: ethdebug/format/pointer/region/stack
description: |
  A schema for representing a region of data in the EVM.

  Describes stack slots as number of positions from the top (at time of
  observation). Debuggers reading this information **should** immediately
  convert these positions to absolute positions from the bottom.

  This schema is constructed by extending the base region schema
  and the schema for the segment addressing scheme.
