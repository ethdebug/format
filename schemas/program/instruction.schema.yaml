title: ethdebug/format/program/instruction
description: |
  A schema for representing the information pertaining to a particular
  instruction in machine code.

type: object

properties:
  offset:
    title: Instruction byte offset
    description: |
      The byte offset where the instruction begins within the bytecode.

      For legacy contract bytecode (non-EOF), this value is equivalent to the
      instruction's program counter. For EOF bytecode, this value **must** be
      the offset from the start of the container, not the start of a particular
      code section within that container.

  operation:
    title: Machine operation information
    type: object
    properties:
      mnemonic:
        description: The mnemonic operation code (PUSH1, e.g.)
        type: string

      arguments:
        description: The immediate arguments to the operation, if relevant.
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        items:
          description: |
            An immediate value specified as argument to the opcode

    required:
      - mnemonic

  context:
    description: |
      The context known to exist following the execution of this instruction.

      This field is **optional**. Omitting it is equivalent to specifying the
      empty context value (`{}`).
