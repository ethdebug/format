description: |
  A schema for representing the information pertaining to a particular
  instruction in machine code.

type: object

properties:
  offset:
    title: Instruction byte offset
    description: |
      The byte offset where the instruction begins within the bytecode.

      For legacy contract bytecode (non-EOF), this value is equivalent to the
      instruction's program counter. For EOF bytecode, this value **must** be
      the offset from the start of the container, not the start of a particular
      code section within that container.
