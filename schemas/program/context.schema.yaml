title: ethdebug/format/program/context
description: |
  An **ethdebug/format/program/context** object represents compile-time
  information about the high-level runtime execution state at a specific point
  in a program's bytecode.

  This schema provides a formal specification for this format's model of what
  information can be known at compile-time about the high-level runtime. This
  includes data such as a particular machine instruction's source mapping or
  what variables exist in runtime state following some instruction.

  The context object supports dynamic context combination and selection through
  the use of `gather`, and `pick` properties. This allows for flexible
  composition and extraction of context information.

  Contexts serve as a bridge between low-level EVM execution and high-level
  language constructs. Debuggers can use these compile-time guarantees to
  maintain a coherent view of the high-level language runtime throughout
  program execution. This enables debugging tools to map execution points to
  source code, reconstruct variable states, provide meaningful stack traces,
  and offer insights into control flow and data structures.
