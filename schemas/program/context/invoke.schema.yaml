title: ethdebug/format/program/context/invoke
description: |
  Schema for representing function invocation context at a specific point in
  program execution.

  This context captures information about function calls, including both
  internal function calls (via JUMP) and external contract calls (via CALL,
  DELEGATECALL, STATICCALL, etc.). The schema distinguishes between these
  different invocation types through the use of `internal` and `external`
  boolean properties.

type: object
properties:
  invoke:
    type: object
    title: Function invocation
    description: |
      Represents a function invocation, either internal (via JUMP) or external
      (via CALL opcodes). The schema enforces that exactly one of `internal`
      or `external` must be true.

      For internal calls, only `target` and `arguments` are valid.
      For external calls, `gas`, `value`, `input`, `salt`, `delegate`,
      `static`, `create`, and `create2` may be used as appropriate.

    properties:
      target:
        type: object
        title: Invocation target
        description: |
          Pointer to the target of the invocation. For internal calls, this
          typically points to a code location. For external calls, this points
          to the address being called.

      internal:
        type: boolean
