# Base schema

:::warning
The schema on this page is extended by other, more specific schemas as part of
the larger **ethdebug/format** specification. These other schemas specify the
representation of many common kinds of types (e.g. including signed/unsigned
integers, arrays, structs, mappings, etc.). In order to adhere to this format
fully, compilers that represent known types **should** do so with the
appropriate more-specific schema.

Please see the [**ethdebug/format/type**](/spec/type) schema for representing
these supported types.
:::

This format defines the **ethdebug/format/type/base** schema for
representing data types from high-level languages. These types may be
user-defined or supplied as native data types in a language. This schema
affords the representation of complex/parametric types, whose definition
composes other types (e.g., arrays and structs, which contain at least one
underlying type).

This base schema itself is designed to be extended by other schemas in this
format, namely **ethdebug/format/type**. It serves to specify what is
_minimally necessary_ for a type to be a valid representation (i.e., all type
representations **must** adhere to at least this base schema).

## Differences from **ethdebug/format/type**

This base schema defines the structure of a type representation without respect
to any known kind of type.

### Unconstrained `kind` field

As described in key concepts
[Types are organized by `kind`](/spec/type/concepts#types-are-organized-by-kind)
and
[Known vs. unknown kinds](/spec/type/concepts#known-vs-unknown-kinds),
**ethdebug/format/type** imposes constraints on type representations' `kind`
field. This base schema makes no restriction on the value of this field
(other than it **must** be defined and **must** be a string).

:::note[Note to implementers]
The primary purpose for the `kind` field is to discriminate type objects
into the appropriate corresponding subschema for a well-understood family of type.
Although **ethdebug/format/type/base** does not impose any constraints on
objects based on the `kind` field, it includes this field so as to encourage
the one-to-one pairing between values for this field and corresponding
subschemas.

When extending this schema, there **should** exist exactly one corresponding
schema for each `kind` value.
:::

### The `class` field is always optional

Although **ethdebug/format/type** does not require the `class` field to be
defined for known types, it does require this field for representations of
unknown types.

The **ethdebug/format/type/base** schema does not ever require this field.

### A complex base type `contains` other base types

As described in key concept
[Elementary vs. complex types](/spec/type/concepts#elementary-vs-complex-types),
this format allows the representation of types whose definition
includes other types. Both the primary schema and this base schema
require type composition to be represented via complex types' `contains` field.

These two schemas differ by which type schema this field is
permitted to compose. Naturally, **ethdebug/format/type**'s `contains` field
composes **ethdebug/format/type** representations, and
**ethdebug/format/type/base**'s `contains` field composes
**ethdebug/format/type/base** representations.

As a result of this, **ethdebug/format/type/base** defines its own type wrapper
schema.

## Example schema extensions for particular types

These examples show valid schemas that extend **ethdebug/format/types/base**
for particular kinds of types.

correspond to the canonical **ethdebug/format/type** schema._
