# Key concepts

The **ethdebug/format/type** schema includes definitions for a few
concepts that are worth highlighting here.

## Types are organized by `kind`

:::info[Example: Boolean type]
```json
{
  "kind": "bool"
}
```
:::

An **ethdebug/format/type** type representation is a JSON object with a
`kind` field containing a string value.

`kind` is a required field for all type representations and is used to
discriminate type objects into the appropriate corresponding subschema for a
well-understood family of type.

## Known vs. unknown kinds

**ethdebug/format/type** defines specific subschemas for known kinds of types.
Known types correspond 1-to-1 with a reserved constant string value for the
`kind` field.

Type representations **should** adhere to the specific corresponding subschema
when representing a known type. Type representations **must not** use any of
the reserved values for `kind` for any purpose other than adhering to the
corresponding subschema.

This schema makes no restriction on values for the `kind` field other than
these reservations. For custom variations on known types and to represent kinds
of types not supported by this format, type representations **may** use other
values for `kind` that correspond to associated external subschemas.

Note that this format defines a
[base type schema (**ethdebug/format/type/base**)](/spec/type/base), to which
all representations of unknown (and known) types **must** conform.
For unknown types, [**ethdebug/format/type**](/spec/type)
places additional constraints in addition to what the base schema specifies.

## Elementary vs. complex types

Type representations in this schema fall into one of two `class`es: either
`"elementary"` or `"complex"`. Type representations express this disinction in
two ways (the optional `"class"` field, and the absence or existence of a
`"contains"` field).

- Elementary types do not compose any other types. For example, `uint256` is an
  elementary type. `string` may be an elementary type for languages that whose
  semantics treat strings differently than simply an array of characters (like
  Solidity does).

- Complex types compose at least one other type. For instance, `uint256[]` is
  an array type that composes an elementary type. Complex types in this schema
  are polymorphic in how they represent this composition; see
  [below](#complextypes-contains-field) for information about complex types'
  `"contains"` field.

## Complex types' `"contains"` field

Complex types inherently compose at least one other type and may do so in one
of three forms:
- Complex types may compose exactly one other type
- Complex types may compose an ordered list of other types
- Complex types may compose an object mapping of specific other types by key

All three forms of composition polymorphically use the `"contains"` field.

As described in
[Type wrappers and type references](#type-wrappers-and-type-references)
below, complex types compose
other types by way of wrapper objects of the form `{ "type": ... }`, which
possibly includes other fields alongside `"type"`.

    <TabItem value="singleton" label="Single type">
      This is an example array type, which composes exactly one other type.

      ```json
      {
        "kind": "array",
        "contains": {
          "type": {
            "kind": "uint",
            "bits": 256
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="list" label="Ordered list of types">
      This is an example array type, which composes an ordered list of member
      types.

      ```json
      {
        "kind": "struct",
        "contains": [{
          "member": "balance",
          "type": {
            "kind": "uint",
            "bits": 256
          }
        }, {
          "member": "scoreSheet",
          "type": {
            "id": "<some opaque ID for some `ScoreSheet` type>"
          }
        }]
      }
      ```

      In this example, please note how this struct type represents member names
      with a `"member"` field alongside the `"type"` field, and note how the
      value of `"type"` can be either a complete representation or a reference
      object in the form of `{ id }`.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="object" label="Object mapping of types by key">
      This is an example mapping type, which composes an object mapping of types
      by key.

        "kind": "mapping",
        "contains": {
          "key": {
            "type": {
              "kind": "address"
            }
          },

            "type": {

              "bits": 256
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

## Type wrappers and type references

This schema defines the concept of a type wrapper and the related concept of a
type reference.

Type wrappers serve to encapsulate a type representation alongside other fields
in the same object, and to facilitate discriminating which polymorphic form is
used for a particular complex type.

Type wrappers are any object of the form
`{ "type": <type>, ...otherProperties }`, where `<type>` is either a complete
type representation or a reference to another type by ID.

<details>
<summary>Example type wrapper with complete type representation</summary>

```javascript
{
  "name": "beneficiary",
  "type": {
    "kind": "address"
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example type wrapper with reference by ID</summary>

```javascript
{
  "type": {
    "id": "<opaque-id>"
  }
}
```

</details>


Note that **ethdebug/format/type** places no restriction on IDs other than
that they must be either a number or a string. Other components of this format
at-large may impose restrictions, however.

### Type wrapper schema

<SchemaViewer
  schema={{ id: "schema:ethdebug/format/type/wrapper" }}
  />

### Type reference schema

A type reference is an object containing the single `"id"` field. This field
must be a string or a number.

<SchemaViewer
  schema={{ id: "schema:ethdebug/format/type/reference" }}
  />

## Sometimes types are defined in code

Languages provide certain kinds of types by way of allowing their definition
in user (or runtime) code. These include [struct](/spec/type/complex/struct),
[enum](/spec/type/elementary/enum), and [alias](/spec/type/complex/alias)
types.

Types with definition information **may** include a `definition` field that
specifies the name of the type (its identifier) and/or the source location of
its definition.

:::note

When extending the [base type schema](/spec/type/base) for custom kinds of
types with definitions, these custom schemas **must** require the specification
of such definitions by way of this same `definition` field and its associated
schema.

:::

This format does not prohibit the inclusion of this `definition` field for any
type, so as to support languages where array types, etc. may be defined by name
directly. It is recommended, however, that
compilers implementing this format **should** prefer to use
[alias](/spec/type/complex/alias) type for the common case of assigning a name
to a type expression.
