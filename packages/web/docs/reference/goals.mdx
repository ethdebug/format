# Goals

## Create a universal format

Smart contract languages have evolved independently, each with its own
debugging requirements. This fragmentation makes universal tooling challenging
if not impossible.

The **ethdebug format** seeks to establish a common language for debug
information across all smart contract languages. By defining comprehensive yet
flexible schemas, **ethdebug format** aims to bridge the gap between
different compilers, languages, and tools while respecting the unique
characteristics of each. The goal is to create a foundation that works equally
well for Solidity, Vyper, Fe, and any future smart contract language.

## Enable real-life debugging

The blockchain doesn't forget. Once deployed, contracts are immutable; their
behavior must be understood as-is. Production smart contracts manage billions
in assets, yet debugging them in the wild remains a significant challenge.

The format aims to make mainnet debugging not just possible, but practical
&ndash; allowing developers to understand contract behavior without requiring
special debug builds. This goal recognizes that the most critical debugging
needs occur not in development, but in production where contracts are already
deployed and immutable.

## Optimize for adoption

A debug format is only as valuable as its adoption. The path to widespread use
requires careful attention to the needs of implementers and users alike.

To this end, this project prioritizes:

- Clear, comprehensive documentation with practical examples
- Reference implementations that demonstrate viability
- Designs that respect existing compiler architectures
- Low barriers to entry for tool creators
- Emphasis on incremental adoption paths

## Reduce the cost to understand the blockchain

Every deployed contract represents someone's original intent, but that intent
gets buried under layers of optimization and compilation. Reading the
blockchain shouldn't require manually working backwards through those layers.

Understanding deployed smart contracts should not require specialized
knowledge or difficult-to-use tools. This project seeks to lower both the
technical and cognitive barriers to smart contract comprehension, making the
blockchain more accessible to developers, auditors, and users alike. The goal
is to reveal the original programmer's mental model directly from deployed
code - translating low-level EVM operations back into the high-level concepts
and data structures the developer worked with. By preserving crucial debug
information in a standardized way, contract behavior becomes more transparent
and easier to reason about, regardless of how optimized or complex the
deployed code may be.
