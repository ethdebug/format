# Elementary types

Elementary types are atomic—they don't contain other types. These form the
building blocks that complex types compose.

## Numeric types

### Unsigned integers (`uint`)

Unsigned integers range from 8 to 256 bits, in increments of 8:

```json
{ "kind": "uint", "bits": 256 }
```

```json
{ "kind": "uint", "bits": 8 }
```

The `bits` field is required and must be a multiple of 8 between 8 and 256.

### Signed integers (`int`)

Signed integers use two's complement representation:

```json
{ "kind": "int", "bits": 256 }
```

Like `uint`, the `bits` field must be a multiple of 8 between 8 and 256.

### Fixed-point numbers (`ufixed`, `fixed`)

Fixed-point decimals specify both total bits and decimal places:

```json
{ "kind": "ufixed", "bits": 128, "places": 18 }
```

```json
{ "kind": "fixed", "bits": 128, "places": 18 }
```

## Address type

Addresses represent 20-byte Ethereum addresses:

```json
{ "kind": "address" }
```

In Solidity, `address payable` is a distinct type but uses the same
representation—the distinction is semantic rather than structural.

## Boolean type

Booleans represent true/false values:

```json
{ "kind": "bool" }
```

In the EVM, booleans occupy a full 32-byte word where 0 is false and any
non-zero value is true.

## Byte types

### Fixed-size bytes (`bytes`)

Fixed-size byte arrays range from 1 to 32 bytes:

```json
{ "kind": "bytes", "size": 32 }
```

```json
{ "kind": "bytes", "size": 4 }
```

The `size` field is required for fixed-size bytes.

### Dynamic bytes (`bytes`)

Dynamic byte arrays have no size limit:

```json
{ "kind": "bytes" }
```

When `size` is omitted, the type represents dynamically-sized bytes.

## String type

Strings represent UTF-8 encoded text:

```json
{ "kind": "string" }
```

Strings are dynamically sized. Languages that treat strings as character
arrays may choose to represent them as `array` types instead.

## Enum type

Enums represent a fixed set of named values:

```json
{
  "kind": "enum",
  "definition": {
    "name": "Status"
  },
  "values": ["Pending", "Active", "Completed"]
}
```

The `values` field lists all possible values in order. The underlying
representation is typically a `uint8` (or larger if needed).

## User-defined types with definitions

Some elementary types (particularly enums) are defined in source code. These
include a `definition` field:

```json
{
  "kind": "enum",
  "definition": {
    "name": "OrderStatus",
    "source": {
      "id": 42,
      "range": {
        "start": { "line": 10, "column": 0 },
        "end": { "line": 15, "column": 1 }
      }
    }
  },
  "values": ["Created", "Filled", "Cancelled"]
}
```

The `definition` field can include:
- `name`: The identifier used in source code
- `source`: A reference to where the type is defined
