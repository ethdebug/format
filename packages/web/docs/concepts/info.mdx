# Info

<SpecLink schema="ethdebug/format/info" href="/spec/info/overview" />

This page explains the mental model behind **ethdebug/format** info objects.
For reference documentation, see the [Info reference](/docs/core-schemas/info).

## The info schema is the top-level container

While types, pointers, and programs describe individual aspects of debug data,
the **info schema** bundles everything together. It's the top-level container
that represents a complete unit of debug information for a compilation.

When a compiler produces debug data, it typically emits an info object (or the
closely related info/resources object) containing all the debug information
for that compilation.

## What an info object contains

An **ethdebug/format/info** object includes:

- **Programs** — one for each bytecode artifact (create and call bytecode)
- **Shared types** — type definitions referenced across programs
- **Sources** — original source files (content or references)
- **Compilation metadata** — compiler version, settings, and other details

This bundling avoids duplication — when multiple programs reference the same
type definition or source file, the info object contains it once with
references pointing to it.

## Two schema variants

The format defines two related schemas:

### ethdebug/format/info

A complete, standalone representation containing all debugging data plus
compilation metadata. This is what tools consume when they need full debug
information.

### ethdebug/format/info/resources

A more minimal representation containing compilation-related debug information
**without** metadata that may already exist elsewhere in compiler output.

The distinction exists because compilers typically already produce structured
JSON output with compilation metadata. Rather than duplicate that information,
compilers can emit info/resources objects and let language-specific tooling
combine them with existing compiler output to produce full info objects.

## Expected workflow

The format anticipates this workflow:

1. **Compilers emit info/resources** — alongside their existing JSON output
2. **Language tooling combines** — merges info/resources with other compiler
   output
3. **Tools consume info objects** — use the complete standalone representation

For example, the Solidity compiler might emit info/resources objects as part
of its standard JSON output. A separate tool (perhaps `solc-dbg` or similar)
would then combine these with the rest of solc's output to produce full
**ethdebug/format/info** objects.

The format recommends that compilers ensure tooling exists to create full info
objects, whether through custom compilation modes or companion tools.

## Relationship to other schemas

The info schema connects everything:

```
info
├── programs[]
│   ├── instructions[]
│   │   └── context
│   │       ├── variables[]
│   │       │   ├── type (or reference)
│   │       │   └── pointer
│   │       └── code (source range)
│   └── compilation reference
├── sources[]
├── compilations[]
└── types[] (shared definitions)
```

- **Info objects** reference **programs** — one per bytecode
- **Programs** reference **types** and **pointers** for variables
- **Programs** reference **sources** via source ranges in contexts
- **Types** can reference other **types** by ID (for shared definitions)

## When to use which schema

**Use the info schema** when:

- Building a debugger that consumes debug data
- Creating standalone debug artifacts
- Distributing debug information separately from compiler output

**Use the info/resources schema** when:

- Implementing a compiler that already produces structured output
- Embedding debug data within existing compiler JSON formats
- Building tooling that will combine with other compiler output
