# Finding example pointers

These integration tests seek to minimize the use of bespoke data whose
representations exist solely within the testing-associated code modules.

Instead of containing custom pointer objects defined inline, the integration
tests for this reference implementation use the official pointer examples
that are distributed as part of the **ethdebug/format/pointer** schema itself.

Since JSON Schema does not offer a means by which examples can be named (it
only defines a way to represent an ordered list of unlabeled example values),
these tests rely on searching for particular examples by their use of uniquely
indicative string values (e.g., the "string storage" example pointer is the
only example to contain the string `"string-storage-contract-variable-slot"`).

The logic for doing this search is captured by the `findExamplePointer()`
function:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/examples.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getVariableStatement("findExamplePointer")
  } />

(This function is written as an immediately-invoked inline function so as to
avoid unnecessary redundant calls to `describeSchema()`.)
