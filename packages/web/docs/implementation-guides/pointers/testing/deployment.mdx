# Deploying contracts

Deploying a contract with some EVM bytecode is straightforward with
[EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) JavaScript provider objects,
although it does require making a few RPC requests:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/deploy.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("deployContract")}
/>
