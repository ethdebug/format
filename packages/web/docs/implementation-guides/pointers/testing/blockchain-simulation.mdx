# Simulating a blockchain

:::warning

In case you missed the
[note on the Summary page](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/testing/summary#ganache-warning),
the functionality described in this page uses the unmaintained
[Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) software library for
simulating the EVM. See note for rationale and risk expectations.

:::

This reference implemention relies heavily on the
[`Machine`](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/data-and-machines#Machine)
interface it defines for reading the state of a running EVM; this page describes
how this implementation's integration tests adapt an
[EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) JavaScript provider object
to this interface.

Since the primary purpose of `Machine` is to represent a series of code
execution steps, the adapter described here simplifies the concept of an
execution trace by restricting it to mean that which happens within the course
of an Ethereum transaction. The tests thus define a `machineForProvider`
function to adapt a provider object for a particular transaction hash.

As a result, this code only functions in the context of a provider to a
blockchain whose JSON-RPC exposes the original
[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)'s
`"debug_traceTransaction"` method, which exposes the state of the EVM at each
step of code execution for a particular transaction. Other kinds of traces (such
as tracing the execution of an `"eth_call"` request) are left to remain
intentionally out-of-scope for the purposes of testing this implementation.
Other implementations of the `Machine` interface need not make this restriction.

## Implementing `machineForProvider()`

The `machineForProvider()` function takes two arguments and returns an object
adhering to the `Machine` interface. See the code listing for this function:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("machineForProvider")}
/>

This function is written to return an object whose `trace()` method matches that
which is defined by `Machine`: a method to asynchronously produce an iterable
list of `Machine.State`s. This function leverages two other helper functions as
part of the behavior of this method: `requestStructLogs()` and
`toMachineState()`.

### Requesting "struct logs"

The Geth-style `"debug_traceTransaction"` method returns a list of execution
steps and machine states inside the `"structLogs"` field of the response's
result object.

The asynchronous `requestStructLogs` function is implemented as follows:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("requestStructLogs")}
/>

Since Ganache does not have a publicly-documented or easily-accessible exported
collection of types, but since it **does** use string literal types to infer the
specific type of provider request being made, this code can use TypeScript's
type interference to ensure type safety in the adapter:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getTypeAlias("StructLogs")}
/>

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getTypeAlias("StructLog")}
/>

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getTypeAlias("Depromise")}
/>

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getTypeAlias("Dearray")}
/>

These types are not exported by this module because they are internal to
`machineForProvider()` concerns.

### Converting to `Machine.State`

The `toMachineState()` function is implemented by leveraging the use of the
[addressing schemes](/spec/pointer/concepts#a-region-is-specified-in-terms-of-an-addressing-scheme)
defined by the **ethdebug/format/pointer** schema. Notice the use of the various
helper functions, listed below.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("toMachineState")}
/>

#### Helper function: `constantUint()`

Since the interface defined by `Machine.State` is more asynchronous than likely
necessary (certainly it is more asynchronous than necessary for these testing
purposes), many properties defined within `Machine.State` must be converted from
a readily-available constant value into a `Promise` that resolves to that value:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("constantUint")}
/>

#### Helper function: `makeStack()`

Although the specification defines the `"stack"` data location to use a regular
segment-based addressing scheme, this reference implementation distinguishes the
stack from the other segment-based locations because of the use of numeric,
unstable slot values.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("makeStack")}
/>

#### Helper function: `makeWords()`

For other segment-based locations, the `makeWords()` function is used:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("makeWords")}
/>

#### Helper function: `makeBytes()`

The `makeBytes()` function is used for plain bytes-based data locations, such as
`"memory"`:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("makeBytes")}
/>

## Note on loading Ganache

To prevent Ganache's warnings from appearing in test console output, a custom
`loadGanache()` function is defined to suppress known warnings while importing
the module:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/ganache.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("loadGanache")}
/>
