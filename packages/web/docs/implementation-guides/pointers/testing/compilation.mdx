# Invoking the compiler

In being able to test a pointer dereference implementation, it is necessary to
pair each tested pointer with associated EVM code that makes the pointer
meaningful. To avoid solutions such as pre-compiling Solidity or handwriting EVM
bytecode, the **@ethdebug/pointers** reference implementation's integration
tests are written so that each test case is described in terms of Solidity code
that the testing infrastructure compiles when executing the test.

The strategy taken by these tests is to use Solidity's `constructor` mechanism
for allowing tests to specify variable assignment and mutation logic without
needing to manage deployed contract instances. All these integration test cases
thus observe pointers only via the trace of a contract creation transaction.

## Integration logic

This testing infrastructure includes the `compileCreateBytecode()` function,
which accepts input resembling Solidity's compiler input data as argument (i.e.,
the collection of source contents by path and additional contract target
information) and asynchronously returns `Data` with the create (deployment)
bytecode for the target contract.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/solc.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("compileCreateBytecode")}
/>

## The `CompileOptions` interface

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/solc.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getInterface("CompileOptions")}
/>

## "Syntactic sugar"-like helper function

To avoid test cases' needing to describe their associated code samples in terms
of source content by path, test cases that require only a single source file can
use the `singleSourceCompilation()` helper function that provides a more
succinct method for generating `CompileOptions` objects:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/solc.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("singleSourceCompilation")}
/>
