# Observing the machine

These integration tests leverage the `observeTrace<V>()` helper function to
consolidate the logic to setup and execute the testing of a particular example
pointer. This function is designed to simulate an EVM and repeatedly observe the
result of dererencing this pointer across each step in the machine trace.

This function accepts a test case description in the form of an `options`
argument of type `ObserveTraceOptions`. In its simplest form, this object must
contain the following information:

- The pointer to be dereferenced and viewed repeatedly
- Solidity code for a contract whose constructor manages a variable to which the
  pointer corresponds
- An `observe({ regions, read }: Cursor.View): Promise<V>` function that
  converts a cursor view into a native JavaScript value of type `V`

With this information, the `observeTrace<V>()` function initializes an in-memory
EVM, compiles and deploys the Solidity contract, then steps through the code
execution of that contract's deployment. Over the course of this stepping, this
function first dereferences the given `pointer` and then repeatedly calls
`observe()` with each new machine state. It aggregates all the changing values
of type `V` it observes and finally returns the full `V[]` list of these values.

This enables the integration tests to evaluate how a pointer gets dereferenced
in native JavaScript terms, rather than just in the terms of a particular
resolved collection of regions. For instance, this allows tests to specify that
observing a Solidity `string storage` pointer should yield a list of JavaScript
`string` values.

Beyond the "simplest form" described above, `ObserveTraceOptions` defines a
number of optional properties for customizing observation behavior, including to
allow observing pointers to complex types (e.g. arrays) and to allow skipping
observation at times where it may be unsafe. See [below](#interface-definition)
for the full documented code listing for this type.

## Function implementation

The full implementation for `observeTrace` follows:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/observe.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("observeTrace")}
/>

## `interface ObserveTraceOptions<V>` {#interface-definition}

This interface is generic to some type `V`:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="test/observe.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) =>
    sourceFile.getExportedDeclarations().get("ObserveTraceOptions")[0]
  }
/>
