# Test cases

This reference implementation currently defines the following integration test
cases.

Test cases are aggregated into the `observeTraceTests` variable:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/test-cases.ts"
  extract={sourceFile => sourceFile.getVariableStatement("observeTraceTests")}
  links={{
    structStorageTest: "/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/testing/test-cases/struct-storage/",
    stringStorageTest: "/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/testing/test-cases/string-storage/",
    uint256ArrayMemoryTest: "/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/testing/test-cases/uint256-array-memory/",
  }}
  />

To see a brief introduction and the relevant code listings for each test case,
please use the sidebar navigation or the hyperlinks included above.

This variable will be used to generate automated tests dynamically, as will
be described in the next section
[Hooking up Jest](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/testing/jest).
