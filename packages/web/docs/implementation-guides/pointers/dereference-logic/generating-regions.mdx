# Generating regions on the fly

The `dereference()` function internally creates an
[AsyncIterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncIterator)
to produce an asynchronous list of regions.

The process to produce this list uses a stack of processing requests (which
it calls "memos"), consuming one memo at a time from the top of the stack
and handling it based on what kind of memo it is.

This is defined by the `generateRegions()` function (defined in conjunction
with `GenerateRegionsOptions`):

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/generate.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getInterface("GenerateRegionsOptions")}
/>

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/generate.ts"
  extract={sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("generateRegions")}
  />
</details>

Notice how this function initializes two mutable records collections: one for
all the current named regions, and one for all the current variables. As
this function's `while()` loop operates on the stack, memos for saving new
named regions or updating variable values may appear and then get handled
appropriately.

For reference, see the `memo.ts` module for type definitions for each of the
three types of memo and their corresponding helper constructor functions.

The real bulk of what `generateRegions()` does, however, is hidden inside the
call `yield* processPointer()`.

## Processing a pointer

To handle a `DereferencePointer` memo from the stack inside
`generateRegions()`, it defers to the `processPointer()` generator function.

The signature of this function and associated types are as follows:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={
    (sourceFile, project) => {
      const definition = sourceFile.getFunction("processPointer");
      const tempSourceFile = project.createSourceFile(
        "dereference-process.ts",
        "",
        { overwrite: true }
      );

      for (const importDeclaration of sourceFile.getImportDeclarations()) {
        tempSourceFile.addImportDeclaration(importDeclaration.getStructure());
      }

      const typeAliases = sourceFile.getTypeAliases();
      for (const typeAlias of typeAliases) {
        tempSourceFile.addTypeAlias(typeAlias.getStructure());
      }

      const commentText = definition.getLeadingCommentRanges()
        .map(range =>
          sourceFile.getFullText()
            .substring(range.getPos(), range.getEnd()))
        .join("\n");

      const declaration = tempSourceFile.addFunction({
        name: definition.getName(),
        parameters: definition.getParameters()
          .map((param, index, array) => ({
            name: param.getName(),
            type: param.getType().getText(param),
            hasQuestionToken: param.hasQuestionToken() || param.hasInitializer(),
            leadingTrivia: "\n",
            trailingTrivia: index < array.length - 1 ? undefined : "\n"
          })),
        returnType: "Process", // HACK hardcoded
        hasDeclareKeyword: true,
        isAsync: true,
        leadingTrivia: `${commentText}\n`
      });

      return tempSourceFile.getFunction("processPointer");
    }

} />

The `ProcessOptions` interface captures the runtime data at a particular
point in the region generation process:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getInterface("ProcessOptions")}
/>

The `Process` type alias provides a short type alias for functions like
`processPointer` to use:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getTypeAlias("Process")}
/>

Effectively, by returning a `Process`, the `processPointer()` has two
different mechanisms of data return:

- By being a JavaScript `AsyncGenerator`, it produces `Cursor.Region` objects
  one at a time, emitted as a side effect of execution (via JavaScript `yield`)
- Upon completion of exection, the return value is a list of memos to be
  added to the stack.

**Note** that the expected behavior for this implementation is that the
returned list of memos should be pushed onto the stack in reverse order,
so that earlier memos in the list will be processed before later ones.

## Processing a region

The simplest kind of pointer is just a single region. (Remember that pointers
are either regions or collections of other pointers.)

There is complexity hidden by function calls here, but nonetheless first
consider the implementation of the `processRegion()` function as a base case:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("processRegion")}
/>

Effectively, this function converts a `Pointer.Region` into a
fully-evaluated, concrete `Cursor.Region`, emits this concrete region as the
next `yield`ed value in the asynchronous list of regions, and possibly issues
a request to save this region to process state by its name.

This pointer evaluation process will be described later.

## Processing collections

The recursive cases are fairly straightforward following this architecture.

### Groups

The simplest collection, a group of other pointers, yields no regions of its
own, but instead pushes each of its child pointers for evaluation later:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("processGroup")}
/>

It's essential that each of the child pointers get evaluated in the order
they appear in the list, since later pointers may reference regions named
earlier, etc.

### Lists

List collections are more complex because they dynamically generate a number
of composed pointers based on a runtime count value and introducing a
variable identifier for use inside the dynamic composed pointer evaluation.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("processList")}
/>

Note how, because each dynamic child pointer is evaluated based on the
next incremented index value, the memos for updating this variable and
evaluation the child pointer must be interspersed.

### Conditionals

Conditional pointers evaluate to a child pointer given that some runtime
condition evaluates to a nonzero value, optionally evaluating to a different
pointer when that conditional fails.

Evaluating a conditional thus becomes a simple matter of evaluating the
`"if"` clause and issuing a memo for dereferencing the `"then"` pointer or
the `"else"` pointer if it is specified:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("processConditional")}
/>

### Scopes

Finally, the last kind of collection defined by this schema is for defining
a scope of variables by identifier by specifying the expression values for
each of those variables.

Since this schema takes advantage of how JSON objects are ordered lists of
key/value pairs, variables specified later may reference variables specified
earlier. The only trickiness in implementing `processScope` is ensuring that
variable values are available immediately.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/dereference/process.ts"
  extract={(sourceFile) => sourceFile.getFunction("processScope")}
/>
