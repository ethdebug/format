# The dereference function

These next few pages cover how the components described thus far are combined
to create the final `dereference(pointer: Pointer)` function.

- The [Summary](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/dereference-logic/summary)
  page broadly describes the control flow structure behind this function
  implementation.

- [Generating regions on the fly](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/dereference-logic/generating-regions)
  describes the process of recursively processing a pointer and reducing it to
  a concrete list of fully-evaluated `Cursor.Region` objects.

- [Making regions concrete](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/dereference-logic/making-regions-concrete)
  describes the process for converting a single `Pointer.Region` object into
  its fully-evaluated `Cursor.Region` equivalent at runtime.
