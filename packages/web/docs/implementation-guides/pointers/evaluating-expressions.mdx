# Evaluating pointer expressions

Expression evaluation is a bit more interesting than reading raw region data,
but, still, performing this evaluation becomes relatively straightforward
if variable and region references are pre-evaluated:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getExportedDeclarations()
      .get("EvaluateOptions")
      [0]
  } />

The main `evaluate()` function uses type guards to dispatch to the appropriate
specific logic based on the kind of expression:

<details>
<summary>Source code of `evaluate(expression: Pointer.Expression, options: EvaluateOptions)`</summary>

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getExportedDeclarations()
      .get("evaluate")
      [0]
  } />

</details>

## Evaluating constants, literals, and variables

Evaluating constant expressions is quite straightforward:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateConstant")
  } />

Evaluating literals involves detecting hex string vs. number and converting
appropriate to bytes:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateLiteral")
  } />

Variable lookups, of course, require consulting the `variables` map passed
in `EvaluateOptions`:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateVariable")
  } />

## Evaluating arithmetic operations

Doing arithmetic operations follows the logic one might expect: recurse on
the operands of the expression and join the results appropriately. Note the
slight differences in implementation for operations that accept any number
of operands (sums, products), vs. operations that only accept two operands
(differences, quotients, remainders).

Evaluating sums:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateArithmeticSum")
  } />

Evaluating products:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateArithmeticProduct")
  } />

Evaluating differences:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateArithmeticDifference")
  } />

**Note** how this function operates on unsigned values only by bounding the
result below at 0.

Evaluating quotients:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateArithmeticQuotient")
  } />

(Quotients of course use integer division only.)

Evaluating remainders:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateArithmeticRemainder")
  } />

## Evaluating resize expressions

This schema provides the `{ "$sized<N>": <expression> }` construct to allow
explicitly resizing a subexpression. This implementation uses the
[`Data.prototype.resizeTo()`](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/data-and-machines)
method to perform this operation.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateResize")
  } />

## Evaluating keccak256 hashes

Many data types in storage are addressed by way of keccak256 hashing. This
process is somewhat non-trivial because the bytes width of the inputs and the
process for concatenating them must match compiler behavior exactly.

See Solidity's
[Layout of State Variables in Storage](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html)
documentation for an example of how one high-level EVM language makes heavy
use of hashing to allocate persistent data.

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateKeccak256")
  } />

## Evaluating property lookups

Pointer expressions can compose values taken from the properties of other,
named regions. This not only provides a convenient way to avoid duplication
when writing pointer expressions, but also it is necessary for types with
particularly complex data allocations.

Currently, the specification defines lookup operations for three properties:
`offset`, `length`, and `slot`. Runtime checks are required to prevent
accessing properties that aren't available on the target region (e.g.
memory regions do not contain a `slot` property).

Since all of these lookups function in the same way, this reference
implementation needs only a single
`evaluateLookup<O extends "slot" | "offset" | "length">` function:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateLookup")
  } />

(The use of generic types here serves mostly to appease the type-checker; the
minimal type safety it affords is insignificant compared to runtime data
consistency concerns, which hopefully the implementation makes clear via its
use of runtime definedness checks.)

## Evaluating machine state reads

Finally, the last kind of expression defined by this specification is for
reading raw data from the machine state. A `Pointer.Expression.Read` should
evaluate to the raw bytes stored at runtime in the region identified by a
particular name.

Thanks to `evaluate()`'s requirement that its input regions-by-name map
contains only concrete
[`Cursor.Region`](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/cursors)
objects, and by leveraging the existing
[`read()` functionality](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/reading-from-regions),
this function presents no surprises:

<CodeListing
  packageName="@ethdebug/pointers"
  sourcePath="src/evaluate.ts"
  extract={
    sourceFile => sourceFile.getFunction("evaluateRead")
  } />

## Note on `"$this"` region lookups

Astute readers might notice that these docs contain no mention until now
about how to implement support for expressions that reference the region in
which they are defined, a mechanism the schema permits via the special region
name identifier `"$this"`.

Performing _read_ operations against `"$this"` region is meaningless since
this schema does not afford any mechanism for defining regions recursively
down to a base case (or similar composition). Thus, the only syntactic
construct for self-referential reads resembles, e.g., defining a storage region
whose `slot` is `{ $read: "$this" }`. Evaluating this `slot` would require
knowing the slot before knowing where to read, and knowing the slow requires
knowing the machine value, ad nauseum.

_Property lookup expressions_, on the other hand, are completely
acceptable&mdash;provided they do not include circular references of any cycle
length.

Since the `evaluate<.*>()` functions here are written to accept only one
expression at a time, this reference implementation relegates this concern to a
higher-level module; proper use of `evaluate()` here requires its
`options.regions` map to include a pre-evaluated (albeit partial)
`"$this"` region.

The logic for creating `"$this"` regions and calling `evaluate()` correctly
is described in the section pertaining to that area of the code. Be
forewarned that this reference implementation takes a na√Øve trial-and-error
approach for determining property evaluation order; implementations requiring
a more robust strategy will need to do some amount of pre-processing.
