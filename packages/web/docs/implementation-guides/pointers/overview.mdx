# Overview

Debuggers looking to support **ethdebug/format** must be prepared to
dereference the data allocations used by compilers for all kinds of variables.
Compilers for EVM languages tend to use novel techniques for allocating data,
and, as a result, compile-time descriptions of these allocations require an
expressive syntax.

This format's [**ethdebug/format/pointer** schema](/spec/pointer/overview)
provides such suitable expressiveness, but implementing the logic to read and
evaluate data in this schema requires some careful consideration.

This documentation section describes a reference implementation written in
TypeScript and available as the **@ethdebug/pointers** NPM package.

:::tip
If you're reading this page without first having familiarized yourself with the
concepts/terminology defined by the **ethdebug/format/pointer** schema,
it is recommended that you start by reading the
[Key concepts](/spec/pointer/concepts) page and then study the handful of
example pointers provided by [the schema itself](/spec/pointer).

A fully-detailed understanding of the schema is not necessary for the purposes
of understanding these docs, although if certain concepts are unclear, please
raise the concern in a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ethdebug/format/issues).

## How this guide is organized

These docs seek to provide a guide for implementing **ethdebug/format/pointer**
logic by way of outlining and listing the code for an example implementation.
These pages are ordered so that more primitive components are introduced
and described before the more complex components built upon them.

**A suggestion to
readers who like to skip ahead**: you might want to read or skim the
[Essential type definitions](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types) pages
to familiarize yourself with the nouns that this implementation employs.
