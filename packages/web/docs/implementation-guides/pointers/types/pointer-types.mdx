# Pointer types

## Types and type guards for all kinds of pointers

This package provides the root `Pointer` type and accompanying `Pointer`
namespace, which contains TypeScript type definitions and type guards for
working with **ethdebug/format/pointer** objects.

The `Pointer` namespace is organized itself into namespaces in a nested manner,
roughly to correspond to the JSON-Schema organization itself.

Types and type guards are available for all pointer schemas, i.e., for every
different kind of region and collection.

A [full source listing](#code-listing) follows below, but see example usage to
get a sense for how these types are organized:

```typescript
import { Pointer, isPointer } from "@ethdebug/pointers";

const region: Pointer.Region = { location: "stack", slot: 0 };
const group: Pointer.Collection.Group = { group: [region] };

isPointer(region); // true
Pointer.isRegion(region); // true
Pointer.isRegion(group); // false
Pointer.isCollection(group); // true
Pointer.Collection.isGroup(group); // true
```

## Pointer.Expression

The `Pointer` namespace also contains the `Pointer.Expression` type and
accompanying `Pointer.Expression` namespace. This namespace is similarly
nested, also roughly to correspond to the root JSON-Schema.

See these quick examples to get a sense for this part of the type hierarchy:

```typescript
import { Pointer } from "@ethdebug/pointers";

const expression: Pointer.Expression = {
  $sum: [0, 1]
}

Pointer.Expression.isKeccak256(expression); // false
Pointer.Expression.isArithmetic(expression); // true
Pointer.Expression.Arithmetic.isSum(expression); // true
```
