# Essential type definitions

This reference implementation uses a few fundamental types/interfaces for
cross-cutting concerns. This section describes upfront what these are, since
the rest of the implementation makes heavy use of them:

- [Pointer types](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/pointer-types)
  model the **ethdebug/format/pointer** JSON Schema as TypeScript types
  (including corresponding type guards)

- The [Data and machines](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/data-and-machines) page
  covers low-level concerns of handling raw bytes and interfacing with
  running EVMs.

- [Cursors](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/cursors) are the
  result of dereferencing a pointer; they accept a machine state and produce
  a list of concrete data address ranges corresponding to runtime pointer
  regions.
