# Data and machines

The **@ethdebug/pointers** package includes two abstractions that it uses for
representing low-level concerns:

- `class Data` extends JavaScript's `Uint8Array` to represent sequences of
  bytes and allow conversion to/from different formats (like hex strings)
- `interface Machine` defines an asynchronous API to model a running EVM.
  It includes the sole method `trace(): AsyncIterable<Machine.State>`,
  where the `Machine.State` type represents point-in-time access to a
  running EVM at a particular program counter in a particular execution
  context, etc.

## Data

:::tip
Note how this implementation handles the conversion to/from JavaScript's
`number` and `bigint` types. The EVM orders numerical values' bytes by
starting with the most significant byte first (i.e., they are
[big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)).

When implementing this functionality, be careful not to get this wrong.
