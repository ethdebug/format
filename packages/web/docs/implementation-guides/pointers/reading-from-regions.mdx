# Reading from pointer regions

Being able to read a particular pointer region's data from a machine state
becomes straightforward by restricting the `read()` logic to accept only
concrete
[`Cursor.Region`](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers/types/cursors#cursor-views-and-regions)
objects (rather than attempting to evaluate pointer expressions at the same
time).

Besides just a `switch()` statement for all the different locations of regions,
this implementation uses a small helper function to convert relevant property
values from raw bytes into unsigned integer `bigint`s.
