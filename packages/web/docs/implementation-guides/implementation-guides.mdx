# Implementation guides

This section of these docs serves to provide resources that guide readers who
are looking to implement one or more components of **ethdebug/format**.
Because of the distinct concerns involved in implementing this format on the
compilation side vs. the concerns involved on the debugging side, this page
lists and categorizes the available guides into the appropriate heading.


## For debuggers

<dl>
<dt>**Guide: [Dereferencing pointers](/docs/implementation-guides/pointers)**</dt>
<dd>
This guide provides readers with a tour of the **@ethdebug/pointers**
TypeScript reference implementation, showing example concrete logic for how a
debugger might process **ethdebug/format** pointers.

For an introduction to **ethdebug/format** pointers, please see
the Pointer specification's [Overview](/spec/pointer/overview) and
[Key&nbsp;concepts](/spec/pointer/concepts) pages.
</dd>

<dt>**Other guides**</dt>
<dd>
_Guides for other aspects of debugger-side **ethdebug/format** implementation
are planned and still need to be written._
</dd>

</dl>

## For compilers

<dl>
<dt>**No availble guides yet**</dt>
<dd>
_Guides for implementing **ethdebug/format** support inside a compiler are
planned and still need to be written._
</dd>
</dl>

:::tip[Work in progress]

Sadly, things are looking a little scarce right now. Please stay tuned as work
on this effort progresses.

**Interested in helping out?** If you'd like to help with writing initial
reference implementations for one or more schemas, please reach out in our
[Matrix.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#ethdebug:matrix.org).
