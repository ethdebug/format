# Compiler implementation guides

Guides for implementing **ethdebug/format** support in compilers.

## Overview

Compilers that want to support **ethdebug/format** need to emit
several kinds of debug information alongside bytecode:

1. **Type information** — Describe the types used in the program
   (see [Types](/docs/concepts/types))
2. **Pointer information** — Describe where variables are stored at
   runtime (see [Pointers](/docs/concepts/pointers))
3. **Program information** — Map each bytecode instruction back to
   source-level context (see [Programs](/docs/concepts/programs))
4. **Info/resources** — Bundle everything together with compilation
   metadata (see [Info](/docs/concepts/info))

## Recommended approach

Most compilers can add support incrementally:

1. **Start with types.** Converting your compiler's internal type
   representations to **ethdebug/format** types is usually the most
   straightforward step.
2. **Add storage pointers.** Many storage variables have statically
   known locations, making them a natural next step.
3. **Add memory/stack pointers.** These often require tracking
   allocations during code generation.
4. **Add program annotations.** Source mappings and variable scoping
   at each instruction typically requires the deepest compiler
   integration.

## Output structure

Compilers should emit an
[**ethdebug/format/info/resources**](/docs/core-schemas/info/resources)
object containing shared resources (`compilation`, `types`,
`pointers`), plus individual
[**program**](/docs/core-schemas/programs) objects alongside each
bytecode artifact. See the
[Info concepts page](/docs/concepts/info) for a sketch of how this
fits into compiler JSON output.

## Case study

The BUG compiler is a small reference implementation that
demonstrates the full integration:

- **[Case Study: BUG](./case-study-bug)** — Walkthrough of how the
  BUG compiler generates types, pointers, and program annotations
- **[BUG Playground](/docs/examples/bug-playground)** — Interactive
  demo where you can compile BUG code and inspect the debug output
