# Compiler Implementation Guides

Guides for implementing ethdebug/format support in compilers.

:::note[Coming soon]
This section is under construction. It will explain how compilers can emit
ethdebug/format debug information.
:::

## Overview

Compilers that want to support ethdebug/format need to:

1. **Emit type information** — Describe the types used in the program
2. **Emit pointer information** — Describe where variables are stored
3. **Emit program information** — Describe runtime context at each instruction
