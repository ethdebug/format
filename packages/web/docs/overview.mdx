# Project overview

The security of smart contracts hinges on the availability of robust debugging
tools. As the compiler optimizes a contract, it may move instructions around or
remove them thus weakening its relationship with the original source code. The
debugger then faces the challenging task of reversing these transformations to
enrich the often cryptic artifacts with contexts mapping back to the contract's
source.
