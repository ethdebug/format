# Project overview

**ethdebug/format** is an open specification for debugging information in
EVM-based smart contracts. It provides a standard way for compilers to emit
rich debug data that debuggers can use to help developers understand what
their contracts are doing at runtime.

## The problem

When a compiler optimizes source code into EVM bytecode, it transforms the
original program structure in ways that make debugging difficult. Instructions
get reordered, variables get eliminated, and the connection between bytecode
and source code becomes obscured. Without standardized debug information,
every debugger must reverse-engineer these transformations — or worse, each
compiler-debugger pair requires custom integration.

## What this format provides

The ethdebug/format specification defines schemas for:

- **Types** — Describe the structure of data (integers, structs, arrays,
  mappings) so debuggers can decode raw bytes into meaningful values
- **Pointers** — Describe where data lives at runtime, including dynamic
  locations that depend on execution state
- **Programs** — Describe the runtime context at each bytecode instruction,
  including which variables are in scope and what source code corresponds
  to each operation
