# BUG playground

BUG is a minimal smart contract language designed for demonstrating and testing
**ethdebug/format**. It compiles to EVM bytecode and produces rich debug
information.

Use the interactive playground below to explore how BUG code compiles to
intermediate representations and EVM bytecode.

import { BugPlayground } from "@theme/BugcExample";

## About BUG

BUG is intentionally minimal—it provides just enough
language features to demonstrate the debugging challenges that
**ethdebug/format** addresses:

- **Storage variables** with automatic slot allocation
- **Functions** with parameters and return values
- **Control flow** (if/else, while loops)
- **Basic types** (uint256, bool, address, bytes32)
- **Complex types** (arrays, mappings, structs)

## Compilation views

The playground shows several stages of compilation:

- **AST** - The abstract syntax tree after parsing
- **IR** - The intermediate representation used for optimization
- **CFG** - The control flow graph visualizing program structure
- **Bytecode** - The final EVM bytecode with debug annotations

Hover over instructions in the IR or Bytecode views to highlight the
corresponding source code.
