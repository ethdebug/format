# Specification Status

import StatusLevelExplainer from "@site/src/components/StatusLevelExplainer";
import StatusTable from "@site/src/components/StatusTable";

The **ethdebug/format** specification is actively evolving. Different parts
of the specification are at different stages of maturity, and we want to be
transparent about what tooling implementers can rely on today.

## Status Levels

We use three status levels to indicate the maturity of each schema section:

<StatusLevelExplainer />

## Current status by schema

<StatusTable />

## Guidance for tooling implementers

All schemas have TypeScript type definitions available in
[`@ethdebug/format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ethdebug/format), useful
for both debugger and compiler implementations.

### Ready to implement

The **pointer** and **type** schemas are mature enough for implementation:

- **[Pointer schema](/spec/pointer/overview)**: Has a working debugger-side
  reference implementation (`@ethdebug/pointers`) with comprehensive
  documentation. Start here if you want to build pointer dereferencing into
  your debugger.

- **[Type schema](/spec/type/overview)**: Stable design covering all Solidity
  types.

### Early adopters welcome

The **[program schema](/spec/program/overview)** is under active development.
The core structure (programs, instructions, contexts) is defined and
foundational, but context types for function calls, returns, and reverts are
still being designed.

If you're interested in helping shape this part of the format, we'd love your
input! However, implementations should expect breaking changes as the design
evolves.
