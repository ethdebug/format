# Overview

:::tip[Summary]

**ethdebug/format/data** is a namespace for schemas that define canonical
representations of specific data types, such as hexadecimal strings and
unsigned integers.

Schemas in this namespace exist so that the rest of **ethdebug/format** has
a consistent way of representing these types.

:::

## Reading these schemas

The **ethdebug/format/data** namespace is not a schema itself, but rather
a collection of closely-related schemas.

These schemas (like all schemas in this format) are specified as
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.

Please refer to the following resources in this section, or see the navigation
bar for complete contents.

- [Non-negative numeric values](/spec/data/value)
- [Hexadecimal strings](/spec/data/hex)
- [Unsigned integer](/spec/data/unsigned)
