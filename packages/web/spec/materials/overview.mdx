# Overview

:::tip

**ethdebug/format/materials** is a namespace for schemas about external
resources, including schemas for representing full compiler invocation details,
schemas for individual sources, particular source ranges, and so on.

Schemas in this namespace exist so that the rest of **ethdebug/format** has

This format defines a namespace of schemas for representing external resources
relevant to smart contract debugging.

## Reading these schemas

[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.
