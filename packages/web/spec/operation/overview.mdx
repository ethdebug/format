# Overview

:::warning

This schema is **very incomplete** and is missing subschemas for
several essential kinds of operations.

:::

:::tip

**ethdebug/format/operation** is a JSON schema for describing things that
happen in high-level languages, such as the beginning of a function call or
a variable's declaration as some type.

Debuggers observe machine execution at the low-level and present a view of
the changing machine state using the semantics of the high-level language.
Doing this requires debuggers to keep track of the state of the machine in
high-level terms and identify when machine instructions modify this state.

This schema provides a means for compilers to represent high-level language
operations as part of the annotation for individual machine instructions.
Because of this, this schema inherently lacks a certain runtime completeness
that might be desirable: e.g., compilers cannot indicate "this instruction
is where we recurse into this function the first time", because that
instruction might be used for the first recursion, the second recursion, and
all the recursions.

:::


This format defines a schema for representing state transitions in high-level
language models of computation.

JSON values in this schema represent the point at which some high-level state
change has definitely occurred. Values in this schema are designed for
compilers to include as part of the broader schemas for annotating a specific
machine instruction.

## Reading this schema

The **ethdebug/format/operation** schema is a root schema that composes
other related schemas in the ethdebug/format/operation/* namespace.

These schemas (like all schemas in this format) are specified as
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.
