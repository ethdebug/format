# Overview

:::tip[Summary]

**ethdebug/format/info** is a JSON Schema and namespace containing the
**ethdebug/format/info/resources** JSON Schema. These schemas provide a means
for representing the debugging data pertaining to a particular compilation.

These two schemas serve to address two distinct purposes:
1. **ethdebug/format/info** provides a means for representing a complete,
   standalone, and language-agnostic representation of all necessary debugging
   data. Objects in this schema contain all information specified by
   **ethdebug/format/info/resources** plus additional metadata.
2. **ethdebug/format/info/resources** provides a means for compilers to specify
   compilation-related debug information without also specifying compilation
   metadata that may already be found elsewhere in compiler output.

Due to the common practice that EVM language compilers already provide their
own structured JSON output formats, it is expected that compilers will
primarily produce objects in the **ethdebug/format/info/resources** schema, and
that language-specific tooling will serve to convert these objects plus other
compiler JSON output into the more standalone **ethdebug/format/info**.

This format recommends that compilers **should** ensure there
exists tooling support for the creation of **ethdebug/format/info** objects,
either via custom compilation modes or through the distribution of first- or
third-party tools.

:::

This format defines the primary **ethdebug/format/info** schema.

JSON values adhering to this schema contain debugging information about a
single invocation of a compiler.


## Reading this schema

The **ethdebug/format/info** schema is a standalone schema and does not define
a corresponding namespace.

This schema (like all schemas in this format) are specified as
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.
