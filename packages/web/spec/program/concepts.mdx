# Key concepts

## Programs are associated with a contract's compiled bytecode

This bytecode might either be the call bytecode, executed when a contract
account with this bytecode receives a message on-chain, or the create bytecode,
executed as part of deploying the contract associated with the bytecode.

Reflecting this relationship, **ethdebug/format/program** records contain
a reference to the concrete contract (i.e., not an `abstract contract` or
`interface`), the environment the bytecode will be executed (call or
create), and the compilation that yielded the contract and bytecode.

## Programs contain instruction listings for debuggers to reference

Programs contain a list of **ethdebug/format/program/instruction** objects,
where each instruction corresponds to one machine instruction in the
associated bytecode.

These instructions are ordered sequentially, matching the order and
corresponding one-to-one with the encoded binary machine instructions in
the bytecode. Instructions specify the byte offset at which they appear in the
bytecode; this offset is equivalent to program counter on non-EOF EVMs.

By indexing these instructions by their offset, **ethdebug/format**
programs allow debuggers to lookup high-level information at any point
during machine execution.

## Instructions describe high-level context details

Each instruction object in a program contains crucial information about the
high-level language state at that point in the bytecode execution.
Instructions represent these details using the
**ethdebug/format/program/context** schema, and these details may include:

- Source code ranges associated with the instruction (i.e., "source mappings")
- Variables known to be in scope following the instruction and where to
    find those variable's values in the machine state
- Control flow information such as an instruction being associated with the
    process of calling from one function to another

This information serves as a compile-time guarantee about the high-level
state of the world that exists following each instruction.

## Contexts inform high-level language semantics during machine tracing

The context information provided for each instruction serves as a bridge
between low-level EVM execution and high-level language constructs. Debuggers
can use these strong compile-time guarantees to piece together a useful and
consistent model of the high-level language code behind the running machine
binary.

By following the state of machine execution, a debugger can use context
information to stay apprised of the changing compile-time facts over the
course of the trace. Each successively-encountered context serves as the
source of an observed state transition in the debugger's high-level state
model. This allows the debugger to maintain an ever-changing and coherent
view of the high-level language runtime.

In essence, the information provided by objects in this schema serves as a
means of reducing over state transitions, yielding a dynamic and accurate
representation of the program's high-level state. This enables debugging
tools to:

1. Map the current execution point back to the original source code
2. Reconstruct the state of variables at any given point
3. Provide meaningful stack traces that reference function names and source
   locations
4. Offer insights into control flow, such as entering or exiting functions,
   or iterating through loops
5. Present data structures (like arrays or mappings) in a way that reflects
   their high-level representation, rather than their low-level storage

By leveraging these contexts, debugging tools can offer a more intuitive and
developer-friendly experience when working with EVM bytecode, effectively
translating between the machine-level execution and the high-level code that
developers write and understand. This continuous mapping between low-level
execution and high-level semantics allows developers to debug their smart
contracts more effectively, working with familiar concepts and structures
even as they delve into the intricacies of EVM operation.
