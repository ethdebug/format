# Overview

:::tip[Summary]

**ethdebug/format/program** is a JSON schema for describing compile-time
information about EVM bytecode, organized from the perspective of individual
machine instructions.

In **ethdebug/format**, a program record (or "program") represents one block of
executable EVM machine code that a compiler generated for a specific contract.
This could be either the contract's runtime call bytecode or the bytecode
to create the contract.

A program is structured as a sequence of instruction records ("instructions"),
where each corresponds to a single EVM instruction in the machine code. Each
instruction contains information about the high-level language context at that
point in the bytecode. This allows debuggers to map low-level machine state
back to high-level language concepts at any point during execution.

Key information that programs contain for a particular instruction might
include:
- the source range or source ranges that are "associated" with the
    instruction
- the collection of known high-level variables at that point in time,
    including their types and where to find the bytes with those variables'
    values
- signals to indicate that the instruction is part of some control flow
    operation, such as calling some function from another.

These program records provide debuggers with a powerful reference resource
to be consulted while observing a running EVM. At each step of EVM machine
execution, debuggers can find the matching **ethdebug/format** program
instruction and use its information to maintain a coherent model of the
high-level world, step-by-step.

:::

This format defines the primary **ethdebug/format/program** schema as well as
various sub-schemas in the ethdebug/format/program/* namespace.

JSON values adhering to this schema contain comprehensive information about a
particular EVM bytecode object. This includes contract metadata (e.g., reference to the source range where the contract is defined) and, importantly, an
ordered list of **ethdebug/format/program/instruction** objects.

Each instruction object contains essential details for translating low-level
machine state at the time of the instruction back into high-level language
concepts. This allows debuggers to provide a meaningful representation of
program state at any point during execution.

## Reading this schema

The **ethdebug/format/program** schema is a root schema that composes other
related schemas in the ethdebug/format/program/* namespace.

These schemas (like all schemas in this format) are specified as
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.
