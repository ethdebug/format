# Specification overview

The **ethdebug format** is currently in the design phase and specification is
only just beginning.


## Contents

This specification currently contains the following primary schemas:

<dl>

<dt>[**ethdebug/format/type**](/spec/type/overview)</dt>
<dd>
A schema for representing high-level data types such as arrays of integers,
payable addresses, etc.
</dd>

<dt>[**ethdebug/format/pointer**](/spec/pointer/overview)</dt>
<dd>
A schema for representing dynamic data address ranges in the EVM, particularly
to indicate where high-level variables are allocated in the machine state.
</dd>

<dt>[**ethdebug/format/program**](/spec/program/overview)</dt>
<dd>
A schema for representing high-level semantics from the perspective of an
annotated compiled bytecode.
</dd>

</dl>


In addition, this format defines namespaces containing schemas for common
concerns:

<dl>

<dt>[**ethdebug/format/data**](/spec/data/overview)</dt>
<dd>
A namespace of schemas containing definitions of commonly used data
representations, such as how to represent raw byte strings and unsigned
integers.
</dd>

<dt>[**ethdebug/format/materials**](/spec/materials/overview)</dt>
<dd>
A namespace of schemas for representing "external" resources, such as
compiler source inputs.
</dd>

</dl>

These schemas are specified as [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org)
documents, draft 2020-12.

For the full collection of raw schema listings (in YAML format), please see the
[`schemas/` directory](https://github.com/ethdebug/format/tree/main/schemas)
in this project's GitHub repository.

## Conventions used by this format

### Terminology

This specification uses the term "this format" to refer to the entirety of
this project's scope (all formal schemas and any additional
informally-described constraints). Sections within this specification use the
term "this schema" to refer to whatever schema is related to the section in
question.

This specification uses the terms "known" and "unknown" synomously to mean
"within the scope of this format" and "outside the scope of this format",
respectively.

### RFC-2119

The key words "**must**", "**must not**", "**required**", "**shall**",
"**shall not**", "**should**", "**should not**", "**recommended**", "**may**",
and "**optional**" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
