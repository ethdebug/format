# Overview

:::tip[Summary]

**ethdebug/format/pointer** is a JSON schema for pointing to bytes in the EVM.

Debuggers need to know where to find variables when looking at a running
machine, which means that debuggers must be able to find the related regions
of the stack, memory, storage, etc. where each of the variables in scope live
at any point in time.

This gets particularly complicated on the EVM because many common languages
employ novel techniques for organizing data. (Some of these
techniques serve to work around machine limitations; others serve to
take advantage of the unique way the EVM is designed.) For a thorough
description of how Solidity organizes memory, please see related work
[Data Representation in Solidity](https://ethdebug.github.io/solidity-data-representation/).

As a consequence of this complexity, this schema seeks to allow compilers the
expressiveness required for describing these allocation techniques at
compile-time. To readers continuing on,
a [warning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule) may apply.

:::

This format defines a schema for locating semantically-cohesive bytes ranges
in a running EVM.

JSON values in this schema describe primarily _where_ data is to be found to
identify to debuggers reading a trace (or attached to a running EVM) which data
must be read from which location(s). Values in this schema may address
a single continuous region of bytes or an aggregation of non-continuous related
regions.

## Reading this schema

The **ethdebug/format/pointer** schema is a root schema that composes other
related schemas in the ethdebug/format/pointer/\* namespace.

These schemas (like all schemas in this format) are specified as
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org), draft 2020-12.
